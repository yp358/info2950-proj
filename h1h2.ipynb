    "### Data Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "From our journey of exploring the relationship between music sentiment and key economic variables, we came to the realization that *the navigation of the relationship we aim to discover in simplistic terms requires a further extension of qualitative research*, **especially in terms of addressing which data sources we ought to reconsider and how we address the vast range of music sentiments, and in terms of addressing the complex musical and economic natures**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, we primarily used the Spotify (to get the quantitative values for music sentiment) dataset. Yet, it might be true that the **popularity column of Spotify commits recency bias. In other words, songs that were recently published are significantly more popular than the older ones**. Such matter of wrongful bias could offer explanation in why we are yet to find tracks that is evenly distributed across the years, and our methodologies must be improved to better accurately represent the most representative songs across the decade. Therefore, further exploration of methods to attain better--or more evenly distributed--data must be considered. For example, in the further phases of our analysis, we could use *Billboard charts*, the most well-known American music charting organization, across the years *and link it to the Spotify data* to normalize our distribution across time, and also have a better representation in what the American public listened to at their respective times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we do solve the inequalities of the number of tracks across the years, we must **question the complex nature of music**. Indeed, the preference of vibes are from human endeavor, thus the possibility of those realms being connected by human endeavor and psychological elements can be held. Yet, the factor of *time* makes our relationship with music so excitingly complex. You ask a man in post-World War II--a pompous time in America--what music he listens to, and he'll answer *cool jazz* (a music with solemn vibes); you ask another man of the late 2000s--a desolate time amidst the sub-prime mortgage crisis--what music he plays on repeat, and he'll answer *electronic dance music*. Hence, the variability of musical preference is so severe--not only across time, but across individuals--that pinpointing this into a limited number of songs insults the rich nature of human complexity with music.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is limited to yearly basis due to the lack of monthly data available. (EXPAND ON THIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **economic structure can not be watered down into simplicity either**. Economics, even at the micro scale, is yet to offer a simple equation albeit the centuries of studies by the erudite. The elements of psychology, rational thinking, complex mathematics makes it even harder for one to fully comprehend the damned nature of individual interactions between one party with another. Now, consider the national scale, where many of the key economic indicators we've put in our analysis is a result of millions of interactions. Then, consider governments and federal institutions with different political leanings, of which might enact contrasting monetary and/or fiscal policies even with similar economic conditions. **The multitude of parties and factors involved that produce our key economic indicators explain why music sentiments might not directly show the a strong corelation with one of the economical index we used in our analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation we have is that because **the popular songs that we have for each year is uneven**, we decided to only include popular songs from 2000-2015 where the number of songs is relatively even. This step in data cleaning not only reduce the number of data entries we have but also restrict our datasets to not have recent popular songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Model cannot be addressed with models that we have learned in class. Prior research has been using more complex models to determine the relationship between economic data and music sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, complexities in addressing the data, addressing sentiment, and addressing economy are reasons why we believe that further discussion and research is needed.** Given the complexities of these realms, the over-simplification to a couple of numbers \"algorithmically\" produced by Spotify and a couple of economic statistics can explain the reason why we are yet to find a strong relationship. Thankfully, by adding more variables or implementing better methods of standardization, we are able to at least progress in our question.\n",

    "    - Could genre be one? Tempo? or constricting the range of interest rates? unemployment rates?\n",
