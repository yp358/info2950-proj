    "*State your research question(s) clearly.*\n",

    "*rubric: All expectations of typical projects + clearly describes why the setting is important and what is at stake in the results of the analysis. Citations to related literature are included that might clarify why the research questions are important, or introduce related research.\n",

    "A common interest in both music and finance led the four of us to explore a unique intersection between these fields. Specifically, we asked: could individual music preferences be related to broader economic trends in the United States? Inspired by prior research that suggested promising correlations between music sentiment and market performance (e.g., weekly equity returns) , we decided to investigate further. While excited by the potential connections, our initial data analysis revealed only weak correlations between music sentiment and economic indicators. This prompted us to refine our approaches and think about regression models we could run for the next phase, hoping to reveal hidden trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions:\n",
    "1. **Can the valence of the general population's music preference be predicted by economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, the federal funds rate, and other macroeconomic variables?**\n",
    "   - *Valence* represents the spectrum of emotions in music, ranging from negative (0) to positive (1).\n",
    "   - **Goal:** We sought to determine whether broader economic conditions influence the general emotional tone of music that people gravitate toward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does danceability correlate with valence, and can we predict the danceability of the general population's music preference based on key economic variables?**\n",
    "   - *Danceability* measures how suitable a track is for dancing, ranging from 0.0 (least danceable) to 1.0 (most danceable).\n",
    "   - **Goal:** We explored whether this characteristic, often linked to musical enjoyment, also showed any connections to economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Findings and Methodological Refinement:\n",
    "Our original analysis included all songs in our dataset and yielded extremely weak correlations. We hypothesized that the inclusion of a large volume of less popular songs may have distorted the results, as these songs might not accurately reflect public sentiment or consumption patterns. To address this, we filtered out less popular songs using a *popularity* metric (a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates the most popular songs). We created a cutoff of 70, focusing on the songs with popularity greater than 70 in our analysis to better capture the music that resonates with the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Even after refining our data, we found weak correlations between music sentiment and the wider US economy. However, in future phases, we aim to obtain more meaningful insights into the relationship between music sentiments and economic variables, with the potential to reveal subtle but significant patterns.

    "## Data Collection and cleaning summary \n",
    "**Overall Summary:** The primary task was to match the Billboard song data with Spotify’s sentiment data. This was done by using song titles and artist names as common identifiers. Variations in how song names or artist names were spelled were resolved to make sure the match was accurate. Economic data(eg. Fed fund rate, unemployment rate) was collected through different government sources and merged all economic data into one dataset. Additional control variables were collected to provide context to the economic variables(eg, birth rate, death rate, recession) or other factors influencing music trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Standardization:**\n",
    "- Ensuring consistent formats for song titles and artist names in billboard and spotify dataset\n",
    "- Ensuring economic variables were comparable across different datasets.\n",
    "- Handling Missing Data: Missing values were identified and addressed by either excluding records or using imputation methods depending on the context of the missing data and its potential impact on analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Merged Dataset:** \n",
    "- After the cleaning and merging steps, a comprehensive, standardized dataset was created that included:\n",
    "  - Billboard data (song rankings and deta)\n",
    "  - Spotify sentiment data (emotional tone of songs)\n",
    "  - Economic data (macroeconomic indicators)\n",
    "  - Control variables (additional contextual factors).\n"

    "Includes a comprehensive and clear discussion of different aspects of the data. The reader understands where the data comes from, why it’s useful for the analysis, and any relevant limitations. If needed, another data scientist could easily find the original data using this description and begin to replicate the analysis.\n",

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n",
    "**Observations**: Each row represents a song or an economic indicator for a specific time period. In the music dataset (musicdata), rows represent individual songs, while in the economic datasets (undata, econdata, us_gdp_data, us_entertainmentgdp_data), rows represent time intervals (e.g., months or quarters).  \n",
    "**Attributes**: In the **music dataset**, the columns include variables like **valence** (a measure of positivity in music), **danceability**, **popularity**, **year**, and other sentiment-related metrics. For the **economic datasets** columns include **unemployment rate**, **GDP**, **federal funds rate**, and other economic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why was this dataset created?  \n",
    "The **music sentiment datasets** were created to explore the relationship between musical attributes (such as valence, danceability, and popularity) and factors like popularity or music trends over time. The **economic datasets** were generated by governmental agencies like the **Federal Reserve** to monitor key economic indicators for research, policy analysis, and public transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "The **music sentiment dataset** were compiled by independent researchers, such as Caleb Elgut, likely with no explicit funding. These data sources rely on platforms like **Spotify**, **Billboard**, and **ARIA**, which collected the original data. The **economic datasets** were funded by the U.S. government through organizations like the **Federal Reserve** and the **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis**, as part of their regular efforts to report and track national economic trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?  \n",
    "In the **music datasets**, factors like availability on Spotify, scraping techniques, and modern-day popularity metrics may have influenced the data observed. For example, older songs that were popular in the 1990s may have lower popularity today, potentially skewing the results when comparing them to historical economic data. In the **economic datasets**, revisions in how economic indicators like GDP and unemployment are calculated, government adjustments, and data collection methodologies could have impacted the recorded data. Additionally, the time series nature of the data means there may be adjustments due to seasonal variations or changes in reporting practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?  \n",
    "- **Music datasets**: The data was scraped from platforms like **Spotify**. Preprocessing included cleaning missing values, and ensuring compatibility between different time periods in the analysis (there was no missing values when we loaded the files).  \n",
    "- **Economic datasets**: The raw data provided by the **Federal Reserve** was merged and aligned with the music data for time-series analysis. Preprocessing involved cleaning missing values, ensuring consistent date formats, and aligning economic metrics with the appropriate historical periods for comparison with music data.\n",
